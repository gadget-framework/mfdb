    Version 5.0-0

    Schema changes:
    * Break up case_study's into schemata, ditch case_study_id:

      This is a fairly major behind the scenes change. Postgres separates tables
      into schemas. Before MFDB put everything into the default "public" schema.
      Now MFDB will use a different schema for each case study (i.e. the
      parameter you give to mfdb()).

      Whereas before there was a list of case studies that could be used, now
      you can specify any name to use as a case study. Note that the names are
      case-insensitive, so "North-Sea", "north_sea", "North-sea" are all
      considered the same name.

      This also means you can use pg_dump and pg_restore to backup and restore
      (or transfer to a different computer) individual case studies. For
      examples, see:
      http://mareframe.github.io/packages/mfdb/html/mfdb-package.html

      Finally, the mfdb(destroy_schema = TRUE) option now expects a case study
      / schema name, since it is able to remove just one schema instead of
      removing everything.

      To make upgrades seamless, MFDB 5.x will, if the schema is new, check the
      "public" schema first to see if there is any existing MFDB 4.x data stored
      under the same case study name. If so it will copy the data into a new
      schema. In theory once it's done this for any case studies you use you
      can drop the tables in the public schema to save space, although make
      sure your data is copied correctly first.

      If you look at MFDB data via. psql, then you will need to make sure you
      either set the default schema with "SET search_path TO north_sea", or
      specify the schema in queries, e.g. "SELECT * FROM north_sea.sample".
