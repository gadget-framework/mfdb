== \dontrun{} usages:

* \dontrun{# NB: Requires a PostgreSQL installation, see README

The MFDB package manages a PostgreSQL schema, whilst most examples use a
temporary-file DuckDB database, this isn't possible for all examples. These
examples should be disabled on CRAN testing hosts.

* \dontrun{# NB: Requires a PostgreSQL installation, and creation of extra users

In addition, these examples require an additional user, to demonstrate
permission-setting. These examples should be disabled on CRAN testing hosts.

All examples now use tempfile()

As a special case, the 'examples' schema will pre-load some test data, which is
used by the examples.

All reworked, \dontrun{} only used where truly necessary and postfixed with explanations. See below

Also done.

Tested on R-devel winbuilder, debian stable and ubuntu R 3.6.

* PostgreSQL (10:36)

The database.

== \dontrun{} usages:

* \dontrun{# NB: Requires a PostgreSQL installation, see README

The MFDB package manages a PostgreSQL schema, so many of the examples aren't
useful without. These examples should be disabled on CRAN testing hosts.

* \dontrun{# NB: Requires a PostgreSQL installation, and creation of extra users

In addition, these examples require an additional user, to demonstrate
permission-setting. These examples should be disabled on CRAN testing hosts.
